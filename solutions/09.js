// Foor Loop
/*
For loop is used when you know the number of repetitions the loop needs to make. Although While loop and for loop follow the same steps but they have different syntax.
*/
// Syntax :
// for (var i = 1; i<=5; i++) {
//     console.log(i);
// };

// Writing for loop
/*
In the below example, we have used for loop to print numbers from 1 to 20. We have used a variable i which is initialized at value 20. Then, the condition is that i > = 1. If the condition is true, the program prints the number and finally, the variable is updated using shortcut i - = 1.
*/
// for (var i = 20; i > 0; i--) {
//     console.log(i);
// }

// Increment And Decrement
/*
The increment operator (++) increases, and the decrement operator (--) decreases the value of a variable by one. These operators are very helpful when making while loops or for loops.
*/
// i = i+1 --> i+=1 --> i++
// i = i-1 --> i-=1 --> i--
for(var i=1;i<=5;i++){
    console.log(i);
}
